Simple Weather App built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WeatherAPI with focus on functionality. After entering the name of a city, the app will display city, region, country, temperature, weather description, and weather icon.

This app was built with the intent of testing my knowledge of JavaScript and API usage while respecting instructions from The Odin Project.
